description : # MPI Random Walker Simulation

This project simulates random walkers moving across a 1D domain using MPI (Message Passing Interface) for parallel processing in C++.

## Overview

-Each MPI process controls a segment of the domain.
-Multiple walkers start in each process with random step counts.
-Walkers move step-by-step and are passed to the next process if they cross local boundaries.
-At the last process, walkers wrap around to the start of the domain.

## Features

-Parallel processing using MPI
-Randomized walker step counts
-Inter-process communication with MPI_Send and MPI_Recv

## Requirements

-C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
-MPI library (e.g., MPICH, OpenMPI)

## Compilation

```bash
mpic++ -o random_walker main.cpp
