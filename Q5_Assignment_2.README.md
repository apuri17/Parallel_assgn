# MPI Parallel Reduction - Sum of Array Elements

This project demonstrates **parallel reduction** using **MPI** to compute the **sum of elements in an array** efficiently across multiple processes.

## Overview

- An array of 100 random numbers (0â€“9) is generated by the root process.
- The array is divided equally among all processes.
- Each process computes a **local sum** of its elements.
- The local sums are **reduced** to a **global sum** using `MPI_Reduce`.

## Features

- MPI functions used: `MPI_Scatter`, `MPI_Reduce`, `MPI_Init`, `MPI_Finalize`.
- Parallelizes a basic numerical operation (sum reduction).
- Efficiently handles array processing with multiple processes.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- MPI library (e.g., MPICH, OpenMPI)

## Compilation

```bash
mpicc -o reduction reduction.c
Execution
bash
Copy
Edit
mpirun -np 4 ./reduction
